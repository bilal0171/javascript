Calculate the area of a circle with this radius (use the formula π * radius * radius) and log the result.

#Exercise 5:
Declare two variables a and b and assign them boolean values (true or false).
Use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine these values and log the results.

#Exercise 6:
Create an array colors with a list of color names.
Access and log the first and last elements of the array.

#Exercise 7:
Add a new color to the end of the colors array and log the updated array.

#Exercise 8:

#Exercise 11:
Write a function isPalindrome that takes a string s and returns true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise.
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

#Exercise 12:
Write a function reverseInteger that takes an integer x and returns its reverse.
If the reversed integer overflows, return 0.

#Exercise 13:
Write a function removeDuplicates that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with duplicates removed.

#Exercise 14:
Write a function majorityElement that takes an array of numbers and returns the element that appears more than n/2 times.

#Exercise 15:
Write a function fizzBuzz that takes an integer n and returns an array of strings with the numbers from 1 to n.
But for multiples of three, it should output “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, it should output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, output “FizzBuzz”.

#Exercise 16:
Write a function isValid that takes a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and determines if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets, and open brackets are closed in the correct order.

#Exercise 17:
Write a function mergeSortedArrays that takes two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 and returns a new array that merges both of them in sorted order.

#Exercise 18:
Write a function longestCommonPrefix that takes an array of strings and returns the longest common prefix string among them. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string.

#Exercise 19:
Write a function countPrimes that takes an integer n and returns the number of prime numbers less than n.

#Exercise 20:
Write a function isAnagram that takes two strings s and t and returns true if t is an anagram of s, false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

#Exercise 21:
Write a function twoSum that takes a sorted array of integers numbers and a target integer target.
Return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

#Exercise 22:
Write a function maxArea that takes an array of integers height representing the height of vertical lines drawn at each index.
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water and return the maximum amount of water it can hold. [Skipped].

#Exercise 23:
Write a function threeSum that takes an array nums and returns all unique triplets [a,b,c] such that a + b + c = 0.

#Exercise 24:
Write a function groupAnagrams that takes an array of strings strs and groups the anagrams together. [Incomplete]

#Exercise 25:
Write a function lengthOfLongestSubstring that takes a string s and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
