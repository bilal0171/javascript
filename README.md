#exercise 1: Declare a variable name and assign your name to it.

#exercise 2: 
Create a string variable sentence with the value "JavaScript is fun".
Find the length of the string and log it to the console.

#exercise 3:
Declare two variables num1 and num2 and assign them any two numbers.
Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these numbers and log the results.

#exercise 4:
Create a variable radius and assign it a value.
Calculate the area of a circle with this radius (use the formula π * radius * radius) and log the result.

#Exercise 5:
Declare two variables a and b and assign them boolean values (true or false).
Use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine these values and log the results.

#Exercise 6:
Create an array colors with a list of color names.
Access and log the first and last elements of the array.

#Exercise 7:
Add a new color to the end of the colors array and log the updated array.

#Exercise 8:
Create an object person with properties name, age, and city.
Access and log each property.

#Exercise 9:
Add a new property hobby to the person object and log the updated object.

#Exercise 10:
Declare a string variable strNum with a numeric value in string form.
Convert it to a number and log the result along with its type.

#Exercise 11:
Write a function isPalindrome that takes a string s and returns true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise.
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

#Exercise 12:
Write a function reverseInteger that takes an integer x and returns its reverse.
If the reversed integer overflows, return 0.

#Exercise 13:
Write a function removeDuplicates that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with duplicates removed.

#Exercise 14:
Write a function majorityElement that takes an array of numbers and returns the element that appears more than n/2 times.

#Exercise 15:
Write a function fizzBuzz that takes an integer n and returns an array of strings with the numbers from 1 to n.
But for multiples of three, it should output “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, it should output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, output “FizzBuzz”.

#Exercise 16:
Write a function isValid that takes a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and determines if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets, and open brackets are closed in the correct order.

#Exercise 17:
Write a function mergeSortedArrays that takes two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 and returns a new array that merges both of them in sorted order.
